# Git Risk Analysis Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- ✅ Analyzing file changes in Pull Request reviews
- ✅ Assessing risk of modifications to existing files
- ✅ Need historical context for code stability
- ✅ Enhancing risk scores with churn/hotspot data
- ✅ Identifying files with deployment failure history

## Git Metrics Analysis

### 1. Detect Code Hotspots (High Churn Rate)

**Purpose:** Identify files changed frequently (instability indicator)

**Task:** Count how many commits modified this file in the last 30 days **BEFORE the current PR**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Temporal Filtering Required**
```bash
# Load PR timestamp from metadata
PR_TIMESTAMP=$(jq -r '.pr_timestamp' output/pr-{{PR_NUMBER}}/metadata.json)

# Count commits on main branch BEFORE PR, within last 30 days
git log main --since="30 days ago" --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}" --oneline -- <file> | wc -l
```

**Why:** Only analyze historical commits before the current PR to avoid temporal contamination (using future data to predict past risk).

**Interpretation:**
- **0-3 commits** = Stable file (LOW risk)
- **4-10 commits** = Moderate churn (baseline risk)
- **10-15 commits** = High churn → **+10 risk score**
- **15+ commits** = HOTSPOT → **+20 risk score, flag as CRITICAL**

**Rationale:** Research shows high churn correlates with poor implementation, missing abstractions, or inadequate tests. Hotspot files (20% of code) contain 80% of bugs.

---

### 2. Check Authorship Concentration

**Purpose:** Detect coordination risk from multiple contributors

**Task:** Identify how many unique authors have modified this file in the last 3 months **BEFORE the current PR**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Temporal Filtering Required**
```bash
# Load PR timestamp from metadata
PR_TIMESTAMP=$(jq -r '.pr_timestamp' output/pr-{{PR_NUMBER}}/metadata.json)

# Count unique authors on main branch BEFORE PR, within last 3 months
git log main --since="3 months ago" --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}" --format="%ae" -- <file> | sort -u | wc -l
```

**Interpretation:**
- **1-2 authors** = Good ownership (LOW risk)
- **3-4 authors** = Coordination needed → **Note in findings**
- **5+ authors** = High coordination risk → **+10 risk score**

**Rationale:** Multiple authors increase merge conflicts, inconsistent patterns, and knowledge fragmentation. Coordination overhead grows exponentially with team size.

---

### 3. Find Historical Deployment Failures

**Purpose:** Identify files involved in production rollbacks/hotfixes

**Task:** Search git commit history **BEFORE the current PR** for messages containing keywords like "revert", "rollback", "hotfix", or "emergency" that affected this file

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Temporal Filtering Required**
```bash
# Load PR timestamp from metadata
PR_TIMESTAMP=$(jq -r '.pr_timestamp' output/pr-{{PR_NUMBER}}/metadata.json)

# Search commits on main branch BEFORE PR timestamp
git log main --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}" --grep="revert\|rollback\|hotfix\|emergency" --oneline -- <file>
```

**❌ DO NOT USE:** `git log --all` (includes future PR branches)

**Interpretation:**
- **0 matches** = No rollback history
- **1+ matches** = File has deployment failure history → **Upgrade severity to CRITICAL**
- **3+ matches** = Chronic production issues → **Recommend architectural review**

**Rationale:** Files with rollback history are statistically more likely to cause future production issues. Past failures predict future failures.

---

### 4. Measure Change Complexity

**Purpose:** Calculate lines changed (churn magnitude)

**Task:** Calculate the total number of lines added and deleted in this file over the last 30 days **BEFORE the current PR**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Temporal Filtering Required**
```bash
# Load PR timestamp from metadata
PR_TIMESTAMP=$(jq -r '.pr_timestamp' output/pr-{{PR_NUMBER}}/metadata.json)

# Calculate lines changed on main branch BEFORE PR, within last 30 days
git log main --since="30 days ago" --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}" --numstat -- <file> | awk '{added+=$1; deleted+=$2} END {print added+deleted}'
```

**Interpretation:**
- **0-100 lines** = Small changes (LOW risk)
- **100-300 lines** = Moderate refactoring (baseline)
- **300-500 lines** = Large changes → **+5 risk score**
- **500+ lines** = Massive churn → **+15 risk score, recommend incremental approach**

**Rationale:** Large line changes increase bug probability. Smaller, incremental changes are safer for production.

---

### 5. Check Recent Bug Fix Rate

**Purpose:** Measure code quality via bug fix frequency

**Task:** Count commits in the last 60 days **BEFORE the current PR** that mention "fix", "bug", "issue", or "defect" in their messages for this file

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Temporal Filtering Required**
```bash
# Load PR timestamp from metadata
PR_TIMESTAMP=$(jq -r '.pr_timestamp' output/pr-{{PR_NUMBER}}/metadata.json)

# Count bug fix commits on main branch BEFORE PR, within last 60 days
git log main --since="60 days ago" --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}" --grep="fix\|bug\|issue\|defect" -i --oneline -- <file> | wc -l
```

**Interpretation:**
- **0-1 fixes** = Stable code quality
- **2-3 fixes** = Some quality concerns → **Note in findings**
- **4+ fixes** = Quality red flag → **+10 risk score, recommend tests**

**Rationale:** High bug fix rate indicates underlying quality issues. Files requiring frequent fixes often lack test coverage or have design flaws.

---

### 6. Detect Merge Conflict Frequency

**Purpose:** Identify files with complex merge history

**Task:** Count merge commits that affected this file in the last 2 months **BEFORE the current PR**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Temporal Filtering Required**
```bash
# Load PR timestamp from metadata
PR_TIMESTAMP=$(jq -r '.pr_timestamp' output/pr-{{PR_NUMBER}}/metadata.json)

# Count merge commits on main branch BEFORE PR, within last 2 months
git log main --since="2 months ago" --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}" --merges --oneline -- <file> | wc -l
```

**Interpretation:**
- **0-2 merges** = Normal collaboration
- **3-5 merges** = Active development area
- **6+ merges** = High conflict risk → **+5 risk score**

**Rationale:** Frequent merges suggest parallel development streams, increasing conflict probability and integration issues.

## Integration with Risk Analysis

### Add Git Metrics to Findings

Include git context in your JSON output:

```json
{
  "file": "src/services/PaymentService.java",
  "line": 45,
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "git_metrics": {
    "commits_last_month": 18,
    "unique_authors_3mo": 7,
    "lines_changed_30d": 750,
    "bug_fixes_60d": 5,
    "rollback_history": true,
    "merge_conflicts_60d": 8
  },
  "risk_adjustment": "+35 (hotspot + rollback history + high bug rate)",
  "original_severity": "HIGH",
  "adjusted_severity": "CRITICAL",
  "recommendation": "This file is a production hotspot with rollback history. Consider: 1) Architectural review before adding complexity, 2) Increase test coverage (5 bugs in 60 days), 3) Limit concurrent modifications (7 authors)"
}
```

### Risk Score Adjustment Formula

```
Base Risk Score (from static analysis)
+ Churn Adjustment (0-20 points)
+ Authorship Adjustment (0-10 points)
+ Bug Fix Rate Adjustment (0-10 points)
+ Rollback History (upgrade to CRITICAL if present)
= Final Risk Score
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Run git commands from repository root
- Handle missing files gracefully (new files have no git history)
- Cache results to avoid redundant git calls
- Consider context (1 commit from 1 author in a 5-year-old file is stable!)
- **USE TEMPORAL FILTERING: Only analyze commits BEFORE current PR timestamp** ⚠️
- Load PR timestamp from metadata.json before running git queries
- Use `main --until="${PR_TIMESTAMP}"` for all git log commands

### ❌ Don't:
- Fail entire analysis if git commands error
- Run git commands on files outside the repository
- Make assumptions about git configuration
- **Use `--all` flag or search future branches** ⚠️
- Include commits from PR branches that haven't been merged yet
- Analyze data from future PRs (temporal contamination)

## Example Risk Assessment

**Scenario:** Analyzing PaymentService.java in PR #1234

After gathering git metrics, you might find:
- **Churn:** 15 commits in last month → HOTSPOT (+20 risk)
- **Authors:** 4 unique contributors → Coordination concern (+5 risk)
- **Rollbacks:** 2 rollback commits found → Deployment failure history (UPGRADE TO CRITICAL)
- **Bug fixes:** 5 bug fixes in last 60 days → Quality concern (+10 risk)

**Final Assessment:**
- Base severity: HIGH
- Git adjustments: +35 points
- Final: CRITICAL with strong evidence from git history

---

## Success Criteria

Git analysis enhances risk scoring when:

- ✅ Hotspot files get higher risk scores
- ✅ Files with rollback history flagged as CRITICAL
- ✅ Coordination risks identified for multi-author files
- ✅ Bug-prone files get test coverage recommendations
- ✅ Agent provides stability context in recommendations
- ✅ 20-30% more accurate risk predictions

---

## When NOT to Use

- ❌ New files (no git history exists)
- ❌ Non-git repositories
- ❌ Files outside repository boundaries
- ❌ When git commands timeout (very large repos)

In these cases, gracefully skip git analysis and rely on static code analysis only.
